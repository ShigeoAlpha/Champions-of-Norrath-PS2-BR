<BEGIN>ACT I

Hate consumes all.
 It consumes one's thoughts. It feeds on violence.
It preys on the hopes of Gods and men.
And in all the Planes, 
hatred's fires burn fiercest in the black heart of the God Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate. Denied his rightful place in the shaping of Norrath, 
Innoruuk cursed his fellow gods and swore that he would have his revenge.
His shadow fell upon the elves' fair city of Takish-Hiz,
where he seized the first of the elven kings and queens,
and carried them away to the Plane of Hate.
Over the course of three hundred years,
Innoruuk tortured them in the fires of his domain,
tearing apart their flesh and souls,
until little was left of the once-proud rulers of the elves. 
He took the hateful shells that remained and made a mockery of the Great Mother Tunare's noble children,
reshaping them into a new race - in his own image.
They became the Teir'Dal, the Dark Elves, 
and they would be the instruments by which
Innoruuk would bring about the Era of Hate,
and at last,
have his revenge.<END>
<BEGIN>ACT II

Certain that Leithkorias' champion had been slain,
the orc leader forged deep into the Underworld.
But his overconfidence would prove his undoing,
for the champion yet lived,
and was closing fast upon his trail.<END>
<BEGIN>ACT III

A great wound on the face of Norrath,
the Pit of Ill Omen was a mighty sea
imprisoned on all sides by towering cliffs.
It was a hidden world,
 containing grasslands, tropical islands,
and even stretches of desert
within its chaotic interior,
all knotted together by mysterious ancient gates,
part of an old riddle that no explorer
had yet been able to solve.
Having barely survived the perilous journey into the Pit,
the wooden boat, in urgent need of repair,
soon found itself the prey of another force.
Not long after their arrival,
evil magic filled the sky of the Pit,
and lightning lashed down from above.
The tired vessel found it had nowhere to flee,
and the storms tore the ship apart.
But there were survivors,
and that meant the battle for Norrath
was not yet over.<END>
<BEGIN>ACT IV

It had been decided,
the impending war was to be halted.
Somehow, Innoruuk's Army
would be destroyed,
or Norrath would fall into
an era of misery and suffering...
a time foretold as
the Era of Hate.<END>
<BEGIN>ACT V

It seemed to be the beginning of the end 
for the people of Norrath.
Innoruuk's Army had assembled,
the planar barriers were about to fall,
and it seemed as if nothing could stop his advance.
Yet as the Army of Hate prepared itself for war,
a strange presence was felt
in the darkened alleys of Innoruuk's Plane.
A dagger, which not only threatened the heart of his army,
but the black heart of the Prince himself.
And so, with victory and ruin balanced
on the edge of a blade,
Innoruuk was forced to take matters
into his own hands.<END>
<BEGIN>Epilogue

With no one to stop his invading army,
Innoruuk's forces marched
on the planes
and overcame the gods of Norrath one by one.
The planes became a great battleground,
and ran so thick with blood
that it spilled across the planar barriers
and a red rain fell upon all of Norrath.
Where the rain fell,
thunderous screams shook the earth,
the ground split,
and canyons opened across the land.
The skies echoed with the screams
of the dead and dying.
The Great Mother Tunare was the last of the Gods to die.
And when the final breath escaped her lips,
a wind blew across Norrath,
dissolving Innoruuk,
the Prince,
and giving birth to a world with only one god,
the God of Hate.<END>
<BEGIN>Epilogue

Without Innoruuk's power,
the hate that had fueled his armies
began to consume itself.
In Faydwer, the orc and goblin hordes
remembered old animosities and turned on each other,
leaving them vulnerable to the armies of the elves.
The battles that followed
were short and decisive,
and the strength of the enemy was broken.
Elsewhere across the planes,
the gods of Norrath drove the invaders back.
Great barriers were formed around the planar portals,
sealing them.
Norrath again became a land in balance,
and all was good.
But what is good...

without hate?<END>

<BEGIN>Any idea where the horn might be?<END>
<BEGIN>Well, I bet some of the villagers might have some clues on where to find it. Maybe even crazy old Lazlo. He was captured when the orc and his slavers hit Water's Edge, though, haven't seen him since. He might be on one of the other islands, still alive, but who knows? If so, you'd probably find him through one of the portals that connects the islands.<END>

<BEGIN>I'm sorry... I got carried away there. It's been such a long time since... well, since anything. The slavers... they tortured me. Then when they couldn't understand what I was saying, they sent me here to work for that cloud giant.<END>
<BEGIN>He's got a secret portal, a portal not even the slavers and their orc leader know about. But the giant's too big to go through it, so he sends slaves out. Out into the ice beyond the gate, to look for something.<END>
<BEGIN>But he's not going to find it, though, is he, Lazlo? Not among those frozen ships with their skeleton hulls, no, no, no. It's already gone!<END>
<BEGIN>But Lazlo's said too much. Maybe you're the orc that that giant answers to, except you're wearing a different skin. A different face to get me to tell you my secrets!<END>

<BEGIN>I came across it by chance, if you can believe it. I had no idea what it was... and for the past five decades I carried it with me, not knowing its power.

<BEGIN>Welcome back, friend... have you brought the stone with you? Never mind, I don't want to know. Buy something, if you will, and be quick about it.<END>

<BEGIN>Back again, I see. Shall I show you what I have?<END>
<BEGIN>Enter Shop.<END>

<BEGIN>Well, now... we don't usually see strangers around here, at least... not alive. You must be tougher than you look to have come this far... or just desperate, perhaps?<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>So... you're the silent type, I see. No matter. Silence is golden, they say. Speaking of gold, I can see that you don't like my prices. Fair enough. There are other deals we can make instead.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>What kind of deal, you ask? Simple fetch and carry, nothing more. You see there are seven... curiosities scattered about in the Dungeons of Khathuun. Mere trifles, really, but each one has sentimental value to me. For each one you bring to me, I'll lower my prices. Bring me all seven, and there may be something else in it for you.<END>

<BEGIN>Yes, we have a deal.<END>

<BEGIN>Gather the 7 trinkets for Gol<END>
<BEGIN>Hidden in the Dungeons of Khathuun are seven trinkets, gather them all and bring them to Gol Nazyn for a reward.<END>
<BEGIN>As you will. My prices, however, stand.<END>
<BEGIN>Enter Shop.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>You think I'm running a charity? I'll drop my prices when you deliver what you promised. Don't like it? Then go somewhere else.<END>
<BEGIN>Enter Shop.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>That's it! You surprise me... with a job well done. But there are many more pieces out there, calling to me. Bring them, and I'll see about dropping my prices further.<END>
<BEGIN>Enter Shop.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Ah, you do not disappoint me. This is beautiful... but this is only part of it. Get the others, all of them, and your time will be well spent.<END>
<BEGIN>Enter Shop.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Splendid... the craftsmanship on this piece is dazzling. Fetch me the others, I must have the whole set.<END>
<BEGIN>Enter Shop.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Another piece... and another step closer to the end of our deal. Think of how much gold you're saving with each of these pieces you give me. Time well spent, certainly.<END>
<BEGIN>Enter Shop.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>You impress me. The prize I promised is almost yours. Bring me the two remaining pieces, and your efforts will be rewarded.<END>
<BEGIN>Enter Shop.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>You've almost done it. You've retrieved all but one. Sadly, without the last one, the other six are nothing but trinkets. Find the seventh, and the reward is yours.<END>
<BEGIN>Enter Shop.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Praise Innoruuk! You've got them all! You've done me a great service, strange one. I think you will find my prices reasonable - very reasonable, indeed.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>But that is but a small gift compared to this one - here, take it. It looks to be a simple stone, but I assure you, it is much, much more.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Don't let its appearance fool you. Can't you feel it? The slight pulse? The way your heart races when you hold it, the way it stirs hateful memories, invigorates them?<END>

<BEGIN>Aren't you a little overdressed for a stroll through Faydark Forest? Maybe you haven't heard, but we're fighting orcs today.<END>
<BEGIN>Your words are wasted on this one, Iurdain. It's but another fool who thinks to be a hero.<END>
<BEGIN>When will Leithkorias stop sending them to us? They don't come prepared, they don't follow orders, and they don't bathe! They're more trouble than they're worth! Mark my words, we'll end up burying this one right next to the others.<END>
<BEGIN>With your charm, Hathnul, it's little wonder we don't get more recruits from Faydark's Champions.<END>
<BEGIN>You will have to excuse my friend, but he does have a point. If you're here to do battle with the orcs or goblins, you'll need to better equip yourself...<END>
<BEGIN>Equip with what? We haven't got any extra provisions. The goblins took everything they could lay their hands on. You might as well go home.<END>
<BEGIN>The Heartwood Master would not be pleased to hear his warrior welcomed with such words, Koail. This knight has traveled a long way to do battle at my father's request, on behalf of our people.<END>
<BEGIN>Forgive Koail's words. These have been difficult times for us all. I am Elgoain, lieutenant in the Faydark Battalion, and son of Leithkorias. You are welcome here among us, champion. I see my father chose wisely, indeed.<END>
<BEGIN>You could not have come at a better time. If you wish to arm yourself with better weapons and armor, then it may be we can aid each other.<END>
<BEGIN>Beyond the rock grotto are two fallen trees which mark the goblins' cave. In this cave you will find the spoils the goblins plundered when they sacked our home of Kelethin. In exchange for spilling goblin blood, you may also find other things there which could be of great use to you on your mission.<END>
<BEGIN>The orcs are retreating deeper into the forest. Spread the word... everyone who is able must report immediately to the Commander near the river.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>What are you waiting for? Find the Commander. He'll put you to work.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Farewell and good hunting. The Faydark Champions are relying on your bravery!<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Thanks for your help, but we're not finished. We must drive back the orcs.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>We plan to regroup near the river, hurry!<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>You are anxious...the battle in Greater Faydark will wait. Return with more protection or you will not make it twenty yards.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>We cannot let you into Greater Faydark wearing what little armor you have.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>On your way now. Stay to the path and our soldiers will help fend off the Goblin's.<END>

<BEGIN>When you try to open the gate, keep your eyes open for Prince Elgoain. I do not know his fate, but he is a brave and honorable soldier, and I will not abandon him to die in that vile hole. If he still lives, do what you can for him.<END>

<BEGIN>I don't know if you've ever met Commander Turanin, but he doesn't like to be kept waiting. So it's up to you to find a way behind the enemy lines and destroy their catapults. It's the only way we can make it through.<END>

<BEGIN>I wasn't sure you were coming through. It's good to see you made it. You should speak to Commander Turanin, he's the one in charge. I've already told him about what you've done, so if he rewards you with more suicide missions, you can thank me.<END>

<BEGIN>You will have to excuse my friend, but he does have a point. If you're here to do battle with the orcs or goblins, you'll need to better equip yourself...<END>
<BEGIN>Equip with what? We haven't got any extra provisions. The goblins took everything they could lay their hands on. You might as well go home.<END>

<BEGIN>Beyond the rock grotto are two fallen trees which mark the goblins' cave. In this cave you will find the spoils the goblins plundered when they sacked our home of Kelethin.

<BEGIN>Glad you made it back. With you by our side, I think there's hope for winning this war.<END>
<BEGIN>The orcs have sealed themselves inside the forest ruins and our scouts spotted their chief's entourage riding into the camp. This means they will attack soon with everything they have.<END>
<BEGIN>We have to get this gate open, and you can help us. There might be a way to open the gate from the orc caves down the river, but up until now, no one's succeeded in reaching the caves... or at least returned.<END>
<BEGIN>She's ready to sail.<END>
<BEGIN>Best of luck, friends. Hope you know what you're doing.<END>

<BEGIN>Best ship I ever built. As long as they don't hit any storms on their journey, they should be fine.<END>
<BEGIN>If you've come on behalf of Lord Vanarhost, you can tell him right now he'll get his boat when it's finished. Sending his friends to check on me every half minute isn't going to get this boat done any faster, understand?<END>
<BEGIN>In fact, you can tell Mister High-and-Mighty I would've had his ship finished by now, except his orc friend threw a fit, broke our lava pump, and took the exchanger. I don't know what that oversized beast wanted with an exchanger, but I can't finish the iron reinforcement plates needed for the keel if the pump's not working. No plates, no ship.<END>
<BEGIN>This job's gonna take twice as long if you stand there watching me. Want to help? Then make yourself useful and go give my apprentice Kol a hand. He's working on the pump that that fool orc broke.<END>
<BEGIN>Of course Kol could have been eaten by a Mammothant. The whole village's been overrun with them. You won't be able to reach him until they've all been cleared out.<END>
<BEGIN>Can't that vampire find anything else for you to do?! Well I can. If you want this ship built, do something about the Mammothants. Then go help Kol with the pump. Until that's done, I don't want to see your face round here again! Now get!<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>At last, you did something useful and killed all those Mammothants. Maybe there's hope for you yet.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Still, before I give you too much credit, you've been giving me the impression that all I've been doing is talking to myself.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Let me explain this one more time. I can't cut the reinforcement plates for the keel without the lava pump. Now Kol, remember me telling you about him? He's a little fellow down in the Blackdelve Lava Field. Help him.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Repair Generator<END>
<BEGIN>Find Kol in the Blackdelve Lava Fields and help him repair the Lava Pump.<END>
<BEGIN>Oh, by the by... watch out for Xorin Shadowson's pets if you go down there. Big ugly stony fellows. They get a mite skittish around strangers.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Back again? Is there something wrong with you? Kol needs help down in the Blackdelve Lava Field. Get the pump working, then we'll talk about your Lord's ship.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Back again? I don't know what you've been doing with your time, but that lava pump still isn't working. Until it is, I can't help you!<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Not only that, but I owe you an apology. Melman told me who you were.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>I said some downright mean things to you, you know, calling you a friend of vampires, cursing your name, calling you an idiot's idiot... well, I didn't say all those things to your face, but, well, anyway, I want to make it up to you.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>You're looking for a boat that can make it to the Pit of Ill Omen in one piece, right? Well, the only rig around that could take that kind of beating is the hulk I've been building for Lord Vanarhost.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Thing is, there isn't enough gold in all the Underworld for me to double cross him. Of course, if I were protected, well, who knows what I might do.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>I hear Melman Froes has a little jewel which keeps him and his daughter safe from vampires. You bring me that ruby, I think maybe I could find a reason to keep this boat out of Vanarhost's hands.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>I heard you talked Melman out of that ruby. You must have used a crowbar to pry it out of his hands. Give me the ruby, and the ship's yours. Won't find a much better deal than that for where you're going, friend.<END>
<BEGIN>It's a deal then, I'll buy the ship!<END>
<BEGIN>Let me consider it awhile.<END>
<BEGIN>She's all yours, then! Finest ship I ever built... look her over, then load her up.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Before you weigh anchor, though, your navigator and I should have a little talk. You do have a navigator, don't you? The Pit of Ill Omen isn't some lazy little stream, and I didn't spend months building this ship just to see her get smashed to pieces. Find a navigator before you set sail or your journey's going to be a lot quicker than you thought.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>So you're back to claim the ship. Wish I could help you, but until I have the Mistmoore Ruby I can't take the chance of angering Lord Vanarhost. Otherwise, next time you saw me I'd have two holes drilled in my neck and I'd be as shriveled as an old prune. Look, I can put him off for now, but I can't do it forever.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>So you're back to claim the ship, and you've got the ruby. I think we can do business.<END>
<BEGIN>It's a deal then, I'll buy the ship!<END>
<BEGIN>Sorry, but I can't let you take the ship until you've got a navigator who can keep you alive! Come back when you've found some fool wh... er, I mean, someone who can do the job.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Hmmm... so now someone else has brought trouble down here from the Overworld. That's the last thing we need. Now I don't doubt that the orcs up there are savages, but we've got troubles of our own.<END>
<BEGIN>Ants, millions of them. And no, these aren't little ants that you find in the sugar bowl. No, no, no.<END>
<BEGIN>These ants are the size of houses, and they're chewing up Blackdelve Reach and the people piece by piece!<END>
<BEGIN>Do you know what it's like to be worried about losing your head every time you open the door?! A Mammothant could be right there, waiting for you, then SNIP! No more head! Being headless is not something this gnome wants to be, thank you very much.<END>
<BEGIN>And if the ants weren't bad enough, something far worse lurks in the shadows. We have a new resident in Blackdelve Reach. A vampire by the name of Lord Vanarhost. He's got all of us gnomes looking over our shoulders. Look... I can't say anymore now. Come to my house later. We can talk safely there.<END>
<BEGIN>Thanks, now let me keep my end of the deal. If you've got a boat, I'll navigate you anywhere you want to go.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Get me on a boat, and I'll take you anywhere you want to go. Blind-folded, even.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Now that's a fine ship. Bingham Viggs' outdone himself this time. Once you've paid for it, I'll be ready to sail.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>That's better. I don't like to air dirty laundry in public. Our troubles are embarrassing enough as it is.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>What were we talking about...? Oh yes, yes, as I'm sure you know, we're surrounded by Mammothants. Oh, Olak Furndt, the local shopkeeper, set some traps for them, but they ate those. And almost got Olak, too.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>If we're going to save our village we need to strike at their heart by killing the Mammothant queen. And by we, I mean, well, you. We gnomes aren't really equipped for that sort of thing. Besides, you're bigger, you'll intimidate the ants more.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>My daughter, Tenya is missing! She... tends to wander, you know, like children do.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>This time, well, she seems to have wandered somewhat far, indeed. It seems she somehow crossed the Blackdelve Lava Field and is wandering in the, uh, Caverns of the Fallen.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>The Caverns aren't too far, I suppose, they lie just on the other side of Blackfire Gap. Some of the gnomes call the Gap a treacherous place, but don't be concerned. Blackfire Gap is monitored from the Iron Tower by Xorin Shadowson. He's a mite unpredictable, but he won't bother you, just watch out for his pets. They're the ones that'll tear you to pieces.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Return Nobleman's Daughter<END>
<BEGIN>Find Tenya and send her home to her father.<END>
<BEGIN>Look, please. Little Tenya is wandering all alone out there, and I'm worried about her. I'll pay any price... just please, bring her back to me unharmed.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>I didn't expect to see you back so soon. But where's Tenya? I'm begging you, find her before Lord Vanarhost sinks his fangs into her.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Thank you for rescuing Tenya. You're as good as your word, better even! I promised you something if you brought my little jewel back, so here's a jewel for you, the Mistmoore Ruby. It's a bloodstone, very valuable, and now it's yours. I hope it brings you wealth and fortune.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Return Nobleman's Daughter<END>
<BEGIN>I've some news that might be of value to you. Lord Vanarhost has an ally, a great brute of an orc, a terrifying creature. I do believe they're in league together and I dread to think what they might be up to. If that brute is the same one that was causing such a ruckus in the Overworld, then I'll be more than happy to tell you where to find him.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Just off our shore, there is a dangerous waterway. Beyond that, is the Pit of Ill Omen, a foul ocean running off into the darker parts of the Underworld. Not a very nice name, I know, but it's a rather ghastly place.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Perhaps that's why that orc feels so at home there. He's been trafficking cargo through the Pit for months now. Deliveries to and from Vanarhost, if I'm not mistaken. If you still want to find him, follow him into the Pit.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>You'll need a sturdy craft to make the journey, though. Try Bingham Viggs. If there's a gnome in Blackdelve Reach who can build a vessel to survive the Pit, he's your gnome.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Thanks again for all your help. If only all overworlders were as capable as you, we might visit the surface more often.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Do you see what the Mammothants are doing to Blackdelve Reach? They're eating it! Chewing it up, house by house! I told Melman Froes this was going to happen, but he didn't listen, oh no.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>But it's not the poor Mammothants' fault. They're sensitive creatures. They don't like loud noises. But, of course, the elders said building lava riders would bring gold rolling into Blackdelve Reach, so there was no arguing with that! Typical! And short-sighted.<END>
<BEGIN>I take it that the lava riders are a problem?<END>
<BEGIN>Sounds tragic, but I have pressing business elsewhere.<END>
<BEGIN>Oh, it's not the lava riders that are the problem, it's the noise they make! The vibrations have driven the Mammothants out of their nest. I mean, imagine what it would be like if someone put a pot on your head and kept banging it with a spoon. No, a hammer, again and again and again and again and... nnnnnh!<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Now the Mammothants are swarming all over Blackdelve Reach. I've set traps, but those ants are huge. There's not much I can do. Traps just seem to make them madder, and that's the last thing we need.<END>
<BEGIN>Might I be able to assist you?<END>
<BEGIN>Not unless you can find the Mammothant queen, and I can't think of anyone who's got the guts to try that. Thing is, as long as she's alive, she's going to keep laying eggs, and this problem's only going to get worse. If there's anything you could do, we'd sure be grateful.<END>
<BEGIN>I'll see what may be done.<END>
<BEGIN>Those Mammothants are still on the rampage. If you can get to their queen, I'd be mighty grateful.<END>
<BEGIN>I'll put a stop to them!<END>
<BEGIN>You did it! I don't know how you pulled it off, but I don't care - I haven't seen a Mammothant in hours! I'll finally be able to get the first good night's sleep in days. I mean nights.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>I can't thank you enough, stranger. Oh wait, yes I can. In fact, I have just the thing. Here. Please accept this as a small token of my appreciation.<END>

<BEGIN>If you've come on behalf of Lord Vanarhost, you can tell him right now he'll get his boat when it's finished. Sending his friends to check on me every half minute isn't going to get this boat done any faster, understand?<END>
<BEGIN>In fact, you can tell Mister High-and-Mighty I would've had his ship finished by now, except his orc friend threw a fit, broke our lava pump, and took the exchanger. I don't know what that oversized beast wanted with an exchanger, but I can't finish the iron reinforcement plates needed for the keel if the pump's not working. No plates, no ship.<END>
<BEGIN>This job's gonna take twice as long if you stand there watching me. Want to help? Then make yourself useful and go give my apprentice Kol a hand. He's working on the pump that that fool orc broke.<END>

<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>At last, you did something useful and killed all those Mammothants. Maybe there's hope for you yet.<END>

<BEGIN>Still, before I give you too much credit, you've been giving me the impression that all I've been doing is talking to myself.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Let me explain this one more time. I can't cut the reinforcement plates for the keel without the lava pump. Now Kol, remember me telling you about him? He's a little fellow down in the Blackdelve Lava Field. Help him.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Help Kol<END>
<BEGIN>Find Kol in the Blackdelve Lava Fields and help him repair the Lava Pump.<END>
<BEGIN>Oh, by the by... watch out for Xorin Shadowson's pets if you go down there. Big ugly stony fellows. They get a mite skittish around strangers.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Back again? Is there something wrong with you? Kol needs help down in the Blackdelve Lava Field. Get the pump working, then we'll talk about your Lord's ship.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Not only that, but I owe you an apology. Melman told me who you were.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>I said some downright mean things to you, you know, calling you a friend of vampires, cursing your name, calling you an idiot's idiot... well, I didn't say all those things to your face, but, well, anyway, I want to make it up to you.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>You're looking for a boat that can make it to the Pit of Ill Omen in one piece, right? Well, the only rig around that could take that kind of beating is the hulk I've been building for Lord Vanarhost.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Thing is, there isn't enough gold in all the Underworld for me to double cross him. Of course, if I were protected, well, who knows what I might do.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>I hear Melman Froes has a little jewel which keeps him and his daughter safe from vampires. You bring me that ruby, I think maybe I could find a reason to keep this boat out of Vanarhost's hands.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Obtain Ruby<END>
<BEGIN>Get ruby from Melman Froes and bring it to Viggs.<END>
<BEGIN>I heard you talked Melman out of that ruby. You must have used a crowbar to pry it out of his hands. Give me the ruby, and the ship's yours. Won't find a much better deal than that for where you're going, friend.<END>
<BEGIN>It's a deal then, I'll buy the ship!<END>
<BEGIN>Let me consider it awhile.<END>
<BEGIN>She's all yours, then! Finest ship I ever built... look her over, then load her up.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Obtain Ruby<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Obtain Ruby<END>
<BEGIN>Before you weigh anchor, though, your navigator and I should have a little talk. You do have a navigator, don't you? The Pit of Ill Omen isn't some lazy little stream, and I didn't spend months building this ship just to see her get smashed to pieces. Find a navigator before you set sail or your journey's going to be a lot quicker than you thought.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>So you're back to claim the ship. Wish I could help you, but until I have the Mistmoore Ruby I can't take the chance of angering Lord Vanarhost. Otherwise, next time you saw me I'd have two holes drilled in my neck and I'd be as shriveled as an old prune. Look, I can put him off for now, but I can't do it forever.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>So you're back to claim the ship, and you've got the ruby. I think we can do business.<END>
<BEGIN>It's a deal then, I'll buy the ship!<END>
<BEGIN>Sorry, but I can't let you take the ship until you've got a navigator who can keep you alive! Come back when you've found some fool wh... er, I mean, someone who can do the job.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Hmmm... so now someone else has brought trouble down here from the Overworld. That's the last thing we need. Now I don't doubt that the orcs up there are savages, but we've got troubles of our own.<END>
<BEGIN>Ants, millions of them. And no, these aren't little ants that you find in the sugar bowl. No, no, no.<END>
<BEGIN>These ants are the size of houses, and they're chewing up Blackdelve Reach and the people piece by piece!<END>
<BEGIN>Do you know what it's like to be worried about losing your head every time you open the door?! A Mammothant could be right there, waiting for you, then SNIP! No more head! Being headless is not something this gnome wants to be, thank you very much.<END>
<BEGIN>And if the ants weren't bad enough, something far worse lurks in the shadows. We have a new resident in Blackdelve Reach. A vampire by the name of Lord Vanarhost. He's got all of us gnomes looking over our shoulders. Look... I can't say anymore now. Come to my house later. We can talk safely there.<END>
<BEGIN>Get me on a boat, and I'll take you anywhere you want to go. Blind-folded even,hands tied behind my back.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Now that's a fine ship. Bingham Viggs' outdone himself this time. Once you've paid for it, I'll be ready to sail.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>That's better. I don't like to air dirty laundry in public. Our troubles are embarrassing enough as it is.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>What were we talking about...? Oh yes, yes, as I'm sure you know, we're surrounded by Mammothants. Oh, Olak Furndt, the local shopkeeper, set some traps for them, but they ate those. And almost got Olak, too.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>If we're going to save our village we need to strike at their heart by killing the Mammothant queen. And by we, I mean, well, you. We gnomes aren't really equipped for that sort of thing. Besides, you're bigger, you'll intimidate the ants more.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>My daughter, Tenya is missing! She... tends to wander, you know, like children do.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>This time, well, she seems to have wandered somewhat far, indeed. It seems she somehow crossed the Blackdelve Lava Field and is wandering in the, uh, Caverns of the Fallen.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>The Caverns aren't too far, I suppose, they lie just on the other side of Blackfire Gap. Some of the gnomes call the Gap a treacherous place, but don't be concerned. Blackfire Gap is monitored from the Iron Tower by Xorin Shadowson. He's a mite unpredictable, but he won't bother you, just watch out for his pets. They're the ones that'll tear you to pieces.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Return Nobleman's Daughter<END>
<BEGIN>Find Tenya and send her home to her father.<END>
<BEGIN>Look, please. Little Tenya is wandering all alone out there, and I'm worried about her. I'll pay any price... just please, bring her back to me unharmed.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>I didn't expect to see you back so soon. But where's Tenya? I'm begging you, find her before Lord Vanarhost sinks his fangs into her.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Thank you for rescuing Tenya. You're as good as your word, better even! I promised you something if you brought my little jewel back, so here's a jewel for you, the Mistmoore Ruby. It's a bloodstone, very valuable, and now it's yours. I hope it brings you wealth and fortune.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Return Nobleman's Daughter<END>
<BEGIN>I've some news that might be of value to you. Lord Vanarhost has an ally, a great brute of an orc, a terrifying creature. I do believe they're in league together and I dread to think what they might be up to. If that brute is the same one that was causing such a ruckus in the Overworld, then I'll be more than happy to tell you where to find him.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Just off our shore, there is a dangerous waterway. Beyond that, is the Pit of Ill Omen, a foul ocean running off into the darker parts of the Underworld. Not a very nice name, I know, but it's a rather ghastly place.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>Perhaps that's why that orc feels so at home there. He's been trafficking cargo through the Pit for months now. Deliveries to and from Vanarhost, if I'm not mistaken. If you still want to find him, follow him into the Pit.<END>
<BEGIN>More...<END>
<BEGIN>You'll need a sturdy craft to make the journey, though. Try Bingham Viggs. If there's a gnome in Blackdelve Reach who can build a vessel to survive the Pit, he's your gnome.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Thanks again for all your help. If only all overworlders were as capable as you, we might visit the surface more often.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Do you see what the Mammothants are doing to Blackdelve Reach? They're eating it! Chewing it up, house by house! I told Melman Froes this was going to happen, but he didn't listen, oh no.<END>

<BEGIN>I take it that the lava riders are a problem?<END>

<BEGIN>End.<END>

<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>I guess it could be worse. I could be dead. But for some reason old sabertooth is keeping me alive. I think he wants me to guide him down the Pit of Ill Omen. After that... hrrrrrk. He's going to tap me like a cask of wine and drain me dry.<END>
<BEGIN>Look, I'll make a deal with you. Get me out of here, and I'll lead you anywhere, anywhere you want to go. Even to the bottom of the Pit itself! But the thing is, the key's not around here... you'll have to go to, uh, Vanarhost's castle and get it.<END>
<BEGIN>If you do, though, watch out. Vanarhost has this lady vampire of his that walks the halls of his castle, and she's a real piece of work. Trust me, you'll know her if you see her. She almost makes me think being a vampire might not be too bad.<END>
<BEGIN>A visitor.<END>
<BEGIN>Do you know why you have come? It is the allure of this place... the allure of the lord of this castle. All of our kind carry such power. You know of what I speak.<END>
<BEGIN>Ah... your heart rate is quickening. I can feel it from here. Beating like a drum. Such sensual music, warm... hungry.<END>
<BEGIN>Is it fear that causes your heart to beat so? Do not be frightened. We are not strangers. You knew of me when you were a child upon your grandmother's knee. Though you dare not speak it, your heart knows my nature, and your mind knows the one word your tongue dare not admit.<END>
<BEGIN>Vampire. Drinker of life.<END>
<BEGIN>I am Sylea, and I know the reason you are here. You pursue the one called Pelys, who wears an orc's face and treats even my Lord Vanarhost as a servant.<END>
<BEGIN>I will tell you where this Pelys may be found, but such knowledge carries a price.<END>
<BEGIN>Before you speak, my price is not blood. Believe what you will, but I have no wish to sink my fangs into any mortal creature like some bloated parasite. I wish to fight these... urges, lest I surrender what is left of the Sylea that was and become no more than a beast.<END>
<BEGIN>At the edge of the sea, near the village of the gnomes, grows a flower called the bloodvine. When I eat it, it... diminishes my urge to feed.<END>
<BEGIN>Follow this hall and you will emerge close to where the bloodvine grows. Bring it back to me, and I will lead you through this castle to this Pelys you seek... perhaps.<END>
<BEGIN>But you must hurry. Without the bloodvine, my urges grow ever stronger... soon, they will devour the last of my resistance, and then nothing will be able to stop my cravings.<END>
<BEGIN>You have returned, yet no bloodvine graces your hand. What of our bargain? Did my words fall on deaf ears? Then heed this. You shall not find the one you seek until you do this favor for me. Return with the bloodvine, and only then shall I expose the throat of this castle to you.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>I warn you. You will never find your way to what you seek until you bring the bloodvine to me.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>The bloodvine... you have brought it. I pray you will never know what it is to need anything as desperately as I need this flower.<END>
<BEGIN>Ah... nnnnh.<END>
<BEGIN>It is enough. I am in your debt. If you still wish to feed upon Pelys' throat, then come with me. I will take you to the beast, but from there, your path is your own.<END>

<BEGIN>And I trust I will be equally satisfied with the bodies you have provided me, Lord Vanarhost... my army is nearly assembled. I was merely waiting for the remaining undead soldiers you promised me. I am pleased I did not have to wait long... I am an impatient man, and there is much to be done.<END>
<BEGIN>Then I will not keep you, Pelys. As promised, I grant you safe passage through my kingdom, this time. I have other guests that require my attention, Pelys. If there is nothing else...?<END>
<BEGIN>Oh, there is much more... I think when we meet again, my Lord, you will find much has changed. Events will unfold quickly from now on... and I shall not forget your loyalty or that of your servant, Lady Sylea. It is a... pity she could not join us.<END>

<BEGIN>Oh yes, I've known you were here in my castle for some time. I allowed you to live until this moment in the hopes that you would follow Pelys and wound his pride further. But you have chosen to inconvenience me instead.<END>
<BEGIN>Let us have a look at you, hmmm. After what Pelys told me of you... I expected something more.<END>
<BEGIN>You reek of the overworld, of sweat. Hardly a meal to quench my appetite. But fortunately, this castle is filled with those with duller palettes, whose tastes are not as refined as mine. I think they would appreciate the sport in a meal that still has some fight in it.<END>
<BEGIN>By your presence here, I assume you have slain the nosferatu... a pity, but such beasts are replaceable. After such a battle, you should have blessed your good fortune and fled while you had the chance.<END>

<BEGIN>Aaah, ye want to try your hand at drivin' do ye?  The last time I let a top-sider like yourself drive one of these hulks, they ended up taking a permanant vacation in the lava flats.  Sorry, but we don't lend out tractors unless you have previous experience.<END>
<BEGIN>I think I can manage, perhaps better than yourself.<END>
<BEGIN>Thanks anyway.<END>
<BEGIN>Your self assurance won't be much help behind the wheel I'm afraid, but if you think you have what it takes maybe we can work something out.^  You can borrow this scrapper behind me, but first you must show me ye can drive one of these machines!  Meet my friends down at the flats -- they race their tractors down there.  I'll give you the fastest one I've got for the race.  If you come in first your free to borrow this one behind me for your needs.<END>
<BEGIN>I'd be glad to try my hand at a race.<END>
<BEGIN>I've changed my mind.  Goodbye.<END>
<BEGIN>Great job!  You put on quite a performance down there.  Enjoy the use of my tractor.  She's ain't much by today's standards, but she'll be plenty for your needs.<END>
<BEGIN>Thanks.<END>
<BEGIN>Whats wrong?  Is everything ok with my tractor?  I should have never lent her to a top-sider....eh ye didn't let Pumpy drive her through Molten Bog did ye?<END>
<BEGIN>Your tractor is fine.  Are your friends racing again?<END>
<BEGIN>Your tractor is fine.  Goodbye.<END>
<BEGIN>Ah, well thats a relief my friend.  She maybe rickity, but I've got a special place in my heart for her.^  My friends are racin' again, but normally they don't let folks in for free.  Are you the wagerin' type?<END>
<BEGIN>I might be, how much are we talking?<END>

<BEGIN>But where has your courage led you, hound of Leithkorias?<END>
<BEGIN>I am told the bite of the spider causes unbearable agony. It's akin to fire flowing through every vein in your body. And just when you think you can endure it no longer, your muscles seize up, your struggles cease, and your body becomes a cage as the paralysis sets in.<END>
<BEGIN>Once you are bitten, I suggest you close your eyes. Or else you'll be able to do nothing but watch as the spider devours you.<END>

<BEGIN>Well, this is as far as I go, which is a lot farther than I intended. The gate to the Underworld is just along there. Be sure to let me know how things are down below, you know, the weather, the monsters, all that. Good luck. I don't envy you.<END>

<BEGIN>Aren't you a little overdressed for a stroll through Faydark Forest? Maybe you haven't heard, but we're fighting orcs today.<END>
<BEGIN>Your words are wasted on this one, Iurdain. It's but another fool who thinks to be a hero.<END>
<BEGIN>When will Leithkorias stop sending them to us? They don't come prepared, they don't follow orders, and they don't bathe! They're more trouble than they're worth! Mark my words, we'll end up burying this one right next to the others.<END>
<BEGIN>With your charm, Hathnul, it's little wonder we don't get more recruits from Faydark's Champions.<END>
<BEGIN>You will have to excuse my friend, but he does have a point. If you're here to do battle with the orcs or goblins, you'll need to better equip yourself...<END>
<BEGIN>Equip with what? We haven't got any extra provisions. The goblins took everything they could lay their hands on. You might as well go home.<END>
<BEGIN>The Heartwood Master would not be pleased to hear his warrior welcomed with such words, Koail. This knight has traveled a long way to do battle at my father's request, on behalf of our people.<END>
<BEGIN>Forgive Koail's words. These have been difficult times for us all. I am Elgoain, lieutenant in the Faydark Battalion, and son of Leithkorias. You are welcome here among us, champion. I see my father chose wisely, indeed.<END>
<BEGIN>You could not have come at a better time. If you wish to arm yourself with better weapons and armor, then it may be we can aid each other.<END>
<BEGIN>Beyond the rock grotto are two fallen trees which mark the goblins' cave. In this cave you will find the spoils the goblins plundered when they sacked our home of Kelethin. In exchange for spilling goblin blood, you may also find other things there which could be of great use to you on your mission.<END>
<BEGIN>The orcs are retreating deeper into the forest. Spread the word... everyone who is able must report immediately to the Commander near the river.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>What are you waiting for? Find the Commander. He'll put you to work.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Farewell and good hunting. The Faydark Champions are relying on your bravery!<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>Thanks for your help, but we're not finished. We must drive back the orcs.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>We plan to regroup near the river, hurry!<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>You are anxious...the battle in Greater Faydark will wait. Return with more protection or you will not make it twenty yards.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>We cannot let you into Greater Faydark wearing what little armor you have.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>On your way now. Stay to the path and our soldiers will help fend off the Goblin's.<END>
<BEGIN>End.<END>
<BEGIN>We are the last line of defense against the Orc Army. We must stay and hold them back.<END>
